Vorbis' audio quality is not best measured in kilobits per second, but on a scale from -1 to 10 called "quality". For now, quality -1 is roughly equivalent to 45kbps average, 5 is roughly 160kbps, and 10 gives about 400kbps. Most people seeking very-near-CD-quality audio encode at a quality of 5 or, for lossless stereo coupling, 6. The default setting is quality 3, which at approximately 110kbps gives a smaller filesize and significantly better fidelity than. mp3 compression at 128kbps.

Most of the time, you will acquire new certificates by verifying signatures in emails, since certificates are embedded in the signatures made using them most of the time. However, if you need to send a mail to someone you have not yet had contact with, you need to fetch the certificate from an LDAP folder (although & gpgsm; can do this automatically), or from a file. You also need to import your own certificate after receiving the & ca; answer to your certification request.

Use this option to change the directory to contain the built sources. There are three different ways to use it: Relative to the & kde; & subversion; source directory (see the source-dir option). This is the default, and the way the script worked up to version 0.61. This mode is selected if you type a directory name that does not start with a tilde (~) or a slash (/). The default value is build. Absolute path. If you specify a path that begins with a /, then that path is used directly. For example, / tmp/ kde-obj-dir/. Relative to your home directory. If you specify a path that begins with a ~, then the path is used relative to your home directory, analogous to the shell's tilde-expansion. For example, ~/ builddir would set the build directory to / home/ user-name/ builddir. Perhaps surprisingly, this option can be changed per module.
