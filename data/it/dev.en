To exactly measure the time passed or record the events happening during the execution of a code region (eg; a function), additional measurement code needs to be inserted before and after the given region. This code reads the time, or a global event count, and calculates differences. Thus, the original code has to be changed before execution. This is called instrumentation. Instrumentation can be done by the programmer itself, the compiler, or by the runtime system. As interesting regions usually are nested, the overhead of measurement always influences the measurement itself. Thus, instrumentation should be done selectively and results have to be interpreted with care. Of course, this makes performance analysis by exact measurement a very complex process.

Getting the gold requires multiple digs in the right places. However, see the next paragraph. To get out, you have to get the enemy to go over the top of the 1 and fill the pit at the bottom. There are three ways to do this. The first and most sensible is to wait on the pole above the top right edge of the 1 until the enemy is almost upon you and then move to the right, digging to your right as you reach the bottom of the 1. The second way involves timing your digging for the gold (or where the gold was); moving onto the gold at the right time will cause the enemy to fall into the pit on the right of the 1. The third way is to destroy the enemy and hope he reappears over the right side of the 1.

Example: Simple testcase: Consider file a. txt (6 lines): aa ba ca da ea fa And file b. txt (3 lines): cg dg eg Without a preprocessor the following lines would be placed next to each other: aa - cg ba - dg ca - eg da ea fa This is probably not wanted since the first letter contains the actually interesting information. To help the matching algorithm to ignore the second letter we can use a line matching preprocessor command, that replaces'g 'with'a': sed's/ g/ a/ 'With this command the result of the comparison would be: aa ba ca - cg da - dg ea - eg fa Internally the matching algorithm sees the files after running the line matching preprocessor, but on the screen the file is unchanged. (The normal preprocessor would change the data also on the screen.)

This area contains a CIE or chromaticity diagram. A CIE diagram is a representation of all the colors that a person with normal vision can see. This is represented by the colored sail-shaped area. In addition you will see a triangle that is superimposed on the diagram outlined in white. This triangle represents the outer boundaries of the color space of the device that is characterized by the inspected profile. This is called the device gamut. In addition there are black dots and yellow lines on the diagram. Each black dot represents one of the measurement points that were used to create this profile. The yellow line represents the amount that each point is corrected by the profile, and the direction of this correction.

Out-of-focus photographs, as well as most digitized images, need correction of sharpness. This is due to the digitizing process that must chop up a color continuum in points with slightly different colors: elements thinner than sampling frequency will be averaged into an uniform color. Thus, sharp borders are rendered a little blurred. The same phenomenon appears when printing color dots on paper. SLR cameras need even more sharpening on a regular basis than consumer cameras.

XML (Extensible Mark-up Language) or RDF (Resource Description Framework). XML is like HTML, but where HTML is mostly concerned with the presentation of data, XML is concerned with the & quot; representationquot; of data. On top of that, XML is non-proprietary, operating-system-independent, fairly simple to interpret, text-based and cheap. RDF is the WC3's solution to integrate a variety of different applications such as library catalogs, world-wide directories, news feeds, software, as well as collections of music, images, and events using XML as an interchange syntax. Together the specifications provide a method that uses a lightweight ontology based on the Dublin Core which also supports the & quot; Semantic Webquot; (easy exchange of knowledge on the Web).

One major cause for data loss (often recoverable) is the unsafe removal of SDDs from a computer. Before data is saved from a computer memory to any attached device, it remains for some time in buffers. In hard drives this means seconds at most, whereas with SDDs it can be tens of minutes. Therefore, before you disconnect a flash device, always activate data flushing through software (often called "safely remove device").

The duration of the critical path determines the duration of the entire project. Any delay of a terminal element on the critical path directly impacts the planned project completion date (i. e. there is no float on the critical path). For example, if a task on the critical path is delayed by one day, then the entire project will be delayed by one day (unless another task on the critical path can be accelerated by one day).

Hide user ID: Checking this option will remove the keyid of the recipient from all encrypted packets. The advantage: traffic analysis of the encrypted packets cannot be performed as easily because the recipient is unknown. The disadvantage: the receiver of the encrypted packets is forced to try all secret keys before being able to decrypt the packets. This can be a lengthy process depending on the number of secret keys the receiver holds.
